## Install

    sudo snap install klee

All klee commands can be used with the `klee.` prefix (e.g. `klee.ktest-gen`). Commands that contained the `klee-<command>` prefix were simply renamed to `klee.<command>` (e.g. `klee-zesti` becomes `klee.zesti`).

This snap also includes two convenience scripts:

 - `klee.run <testcase> <command...>` which can be used to run a testcase. It will setup all the necessary variables for you.
 - `klee.env [CFLAGS|LDFLAGS]` which outputs the flags needed to build or link a program against klee.

An example of its usage, following the [first tutorial](http://klee.github.io/tutorials/testing-function/) could be:

```
$ clang $(klee.env CFLAGS) -emit-llvm -c -g -O0 -Xclang -disable-O0-optnone get_sign.c
$ klee get_sign.bc
KLEE: output directory = "klee-out-0"

KLEE: done: total instructions = 33
KLEE: done: completed paths = 3
KLEE: done: partially completed paths = 0
KLEE: done: generated tests = 3
$ klee.ktest-tool klee-last/test000001.ktest
ktest file : 'klee-last/test000001.ktest'
args       : ['get_sign.bc']
num objects: 1
object 0: name: 'a'
object 0: size: 4
object 0: data: b'\x00\x00\x00\x00'
object 0: hex : 0x00000000
object 0: int : 0
object 0: uint: 0
object 0: text: ....
$ gcc $(klee.env CFLAGS) $(klee.env LDFLAGS) get_sign.c
$ klee.run klee-last/test000001.ktest ./a.out
$ echo $?
0
```

## Remaining tasks

Snapcrafters ([join us](https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/snapcrafters-reboot/24625)) are working to land snap install documentation and the [snapcraft.yaml](https://github.com/snapcrafters/fork-and-rename-me/blob/master/snap/snapcraft.yaml) upstream so KLEE can authoritatively publish future releases.

  - [x] Click the green "Use this template" button above to create a new repository based on this template
  - [x] Give the newly created repository a sensible name, like `godzilla` if you're snapping the Godzilla software (*Note: Do not use `snap` in this name.*)
  - [x] Update the description of the repository to `Unofficial snap for [Project]`
  - [x] Update logos and references to `[Project]` and `[my-snap-name]`
  - [x] Create a snap that runs in `devmode`
  - [x] Convert the snap to `strict` confinement, or `classic` confinement if it qualifies
  - [x] Register the snap in the store, **using the preferred upstream name**
  - [ ] Add a screenshot to this `README.md`
  - [x] Add install instructions to this `README.md`
  - [x] Update snap store metadata, icons and screenshots
  - [x] Publish the confined snap in the Snap store beta channel
  - [x] Update the install instructions in this `README.md`
  - [x] Post a call for testing in the Snapcraft Forum ["Snapcrafters" category](https://forum.snapcraft.io/c/snapcrafters/23) - [link](https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/call-for-testing-klee/35964)
  - [ ] Add the Snapcraft store account (snap-advocacy@canonical.com) as a collaborator to your snap in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.snapcraft.io) and ask a [Snapcrafters admin](https://github.com/orgs/snapcrafters/people?query=%20role%3Aowner) to accept this request
  - [ ] Fix all important issues found during testing
  - [ ] Make a post in the Snapcraft Forum ["store-requests" category](https://forum.snapcraft.io/c/store-requests/19) asking for a transfer of the snap name from you to Snapcrafters - [link]()
  - [ ] Ask a [Snapcrafters admin](https://github.com/orgs/snapcrafters/people?query=%20role%3Aowner) to fork your repo into github.com/snapcrafters, and configure the repo for automatic publishing into edge on commit
  - [ ] Add the provided Snapcraft build badge to this `README.md`
  - [ ] Publish the snap in the Snap store stable channel
  - [ ] Update the install instructions in this `README.md`
  - [ ] Post an announcement in the Snapcraft Forum ["Snapcrafters" category](https://forum.snapcraft.io/c/snapcrafters/23) - [link]()
  - [ ] Ask the Snap Advocacy team to celebrate the snap - [link]()
  - [ ] Submit a pull request or patch upstream that adds snap install documentation - [link]()
  - [ ] Ask upstream if they are interested in maintaining the Snap. If they are:
    - [ ] Fork the upstream project, add the snap build files and required assets/launchers to that repo and submit a pull request or patch - [link]()
    - [ ] Add upstream contact information to the `README.md`
    - If upstream accept the PR:
      - [ ] Request upstream create a Snap store account
      - [ ] Add upstream account as a collaborator on the snap
      - [ ] Contact the Snap Advocacy team to request the snap be transferred to upstream
